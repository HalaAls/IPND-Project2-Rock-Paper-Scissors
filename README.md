# Introduction to Programing Nanodegree Udacity x Misk

## Project 2 - Rock Paper Scissors Game
- Mar 12, 2019
In this project, you'll apply your Python and object-oriented programming skills to build a program that plays the game of Rock Paper Scissors. You'll build classes that represent the game and its players. You'll write computer players that follow various different strategies, as well as a human player class that lets a human play the game against the computer.



## ipnd_rps_starter_code
In this repository you'll find the Python file that contains the starter code for the Rock Paper Scissors project.

Download the `starter_code.py` file, and build your project by adding to that file! When you're done, submit your project by following the instructions in the classroom.

If you want to play with a demo of this project, download one of the `rps_demo` files that ends with the `.pyc` file extension. You should download the file with a number that matches your version of Python. For example, if you have Python 3.7, you should download `rps_demo_37.pyc`. If you run the file with a version of Python that doesn't match, you may get the following error:

```text
RuntimeError: Bad magic number in .pyc file
```

`.pyc` files are _compiled_ Python files. They can be run the same way as `.py` files, by using the `python` or `python3` command in your terminal, along with the name of the file. Like this:

```text
python3 rps_demo_37.pyc
```

But, if you open up this file and try to read it, it won't look like `python` code! Don't worry, the file is fine, we just want you to come up with your own solution to the project. 

Remember, the demo is just there as an example. Your project does **not** have to work identically to the demo!
